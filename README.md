## Overview:
This game use Pygame and Minimax algorithm. <br> 
You will be able to play as X or O in a tic tac toe against an AI.

## Additional Information
As it has been recommended in the course, I have used deepcopy of the board. 
I also used two helper functions for minimax to avoid multiple lines of code for one function.
